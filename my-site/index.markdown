## Greetings Kaizen Companions!

Greetings! I'm Joshua Hendricks, an enthusiastic software developer committed to perpetual refinement and enhancements across my code, projects, teams, and personal journey. I have a genuine affinity for crafting high-quality code, coupled with a keen appreciation for thorough testing. As an advocate for positive impact, I relish the opportunity to tackle challenging problems from inception to resolution. Come join me on this journey of continuous refinement and self-improvement! 

Where does Kaizen come from? "Kaizen" (改善) is a Japanese expression signifying "continuous improvement" or "change for the better." This term is closely linked to the philosophy of ongoing enhancement in different facets of life, encompassing both business and personal development. I refer to individuals who embrace this philosophy as Kaizens.
